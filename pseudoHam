Get dimension of lattice, assume square, n
//Defines states represented by integers 0..2^n-1

Get spin sector to work with, Sz
//This is total Sz, for an even number of sites, this is an integer

Define vector to hold parent states, basis

Define expanded version of integer as an array of booleans, test

Define vector of test-types to hold daughter states, daughters

For states 0<=i<2^n //cycle through all states
	expand integer[i] into test
	if test has right total Sz //only pay attention to those in the correct spin sector
		for 0<=horiz<n //for the application of the 1-right operator to get to all possibilities
			for 0<=vert<n //for the application of the 1-down operator to get to all possibilities
				push translation[test, horiz,vert] into daughters
				for j in all basis so far
					if daughters[last] != basis[j]
						push daughters[last] into basis
